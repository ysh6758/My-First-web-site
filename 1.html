<h2>HTML</h2>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="HTML5 Specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup
language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
We are pleased to announce today that W3C is to become a public-interest
 non-profit organization. <p>The design of the new legal entity has been
  taking several years because of the imperative to preserve the core
   mission of the Consortium to shepherd the web by developing open 
   standards with contributions from W3C Members, staff, and the 
   international community.

</p> <p style="margin-top: 40px;">In the months leading to the launch of 
   a new legal entity in January 2023, we will release further 
   details. Please find more information in our media advisory about 
   the original Hosted model that is being replaced and what it 
   helped W3C accomplish in 28 years, the reasons for change and why 
   we must preserve our standards development process, and our next
steps.</p>
